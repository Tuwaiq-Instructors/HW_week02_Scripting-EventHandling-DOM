# Homework: Task3 

Start of with the following:

- Create a basic HTML ﬁle (called `task3.html`) with a few headings, paragraphs, forms and images. Ensure that each item has an ID assigned to it. You will use this HTML page to get input and display output for each task listed below. Write the JavaScript needed in a ﬁle called `task3.js`.

- Create a function which counts and displays the number of times a `button` has been clicked.

- Create a function to convert rands into dollars, euros and pounds.

- Create a function which creates a drop-down menu with 25 option elements and add it to the HTML page you have created. Each option element should display the number of the option. `Use a loop`.

## Bonus: 

- Create a calculator:
	- It should have the layout similar to the calculator on your computer.
    - Use CSS to help you style the layout.
    - Use JavaScript functions to implement its operation.
